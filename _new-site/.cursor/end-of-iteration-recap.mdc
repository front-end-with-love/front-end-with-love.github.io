GLOBAL RULE:
At the end of every completed iteration, add a short educational summary that explains how this part of the project works.

The summary must include, when applicable:
- Technologies and languages used
- Architecture and component/module structure
- Key algorithms or data flow
- Technical decisions and why they were chosen

Style requirements:
- Concise
- Educational
- Factual
- No fluff, no marketing language

If the task is purely visual or non-technical, explicitly state that no technical explanation is applicable for this iteration.
